## v1.14.1 (Eris)

### Internal

- [NetKAN] `netkan.exe` will now report its version and exit if run with the `--version` switch. (pjf, #1415)

## v1.14.0 (Mimas)

### Bugfixes

- [GUI] The CKAN client is less likely to believe that *all* mods are new when auto-updating metadata is enabled. (Postremus, #1369)
- [GUI] The latest CKAN-available version of a mod is always shown in the 'latest' column, even if that mod is not compatible with the installed KSP version. (Postremus, #1396)
- [GUI] Pressing a key with an empty modlist will no longer crash the client. (Postremus, #1329)
- [GUI] The 'mark for update' button no longer highlights when the only upgrade candidates are autodetected mods we can't actually upgrade. (Postremus, #1392)
- [Core] Installing from `.ckan` files (such as exported modlists) is more likely to succeed even when dependencies are complex. (#1337, Postremus)
- [Cmdline] `ckan.exe --verbose` and `ckan.exe --debug` now start the GUI with the appropriate logging mode. (#1403, Postremus)
- [Updater] We'll no longer try to download a CKAN release that hasn't finished building its assets yet. (Postremus, #1397)

### Features

- [GUI] Updates to the text of some buttons, and change the check mark from blue to green. (plague006, #1352)
- [GUI] The main display shows the download size if known. (Postremus, #1399)
- [GUI] Suggested and recommended mods can now be (de)selected with a single click. (martinnj, #1398)
- [GUI] Mods can be searched by their abbreviation, which we generate by taking the first letter of each word in the title. For example, `KIS` will match `Kerbal Inventory System`. (Postremus, #1394)
- [GUI] The side metadata panel and its elements can now be resized. (martinnj, #1378)
- [GUI] Mod filters will no longer reset to 'compatible' each time the client is opened. (Postremus, #1384)

### Internal

- [Core] Additional tests against autodetected mods in the RelationshipResolver. (Postremus and pjf, #1226 and #1355)
- [GUI] Removed a spurious warning when building. (pjf, #1343)
- [NetKAN] Reading of information from `.version` files greatly improved, especially when mixing metadata from other sources like github and kerbalstuff. (dbent, #1299)
- [Core] Files can now be installed to `saves/scenarios` using the `Scenarios` target. (pjf, #1360)
- [Spec] Grammar corrections. (Postremus, #1400)
- [NetKAN] Files produced by `netkan.exe` have more stable field ordering. (dbent, #1304)
- [NetKAN] `netkan.exe` can use regexps to manipulate version strings. (dbent, #1321)
- [GUI] Refactoring to remove duplicated code. (Postremus, #1362)

## v1.12.0 (Veil Nebula)

### Bugfixes

- [GUI] Hitting `cancel` is much more likely to actually cancel an install-in-progress (Postremus, #1325)

- [Core] We fail more gracefully when mod metadata can't be downloaded (Postremus, #1291)

### Features

- [GUI] Installed mods can now be exported as a "favourites list" via `File -> Export Installed Mods`. Imported favourites lists allow the user to choose which mods they get, and will install the latest versions available for the user's version of KSP. (Postremus, #972)

- [GUI] Yes/no dialog boxes have a more user-friendly title (plague006, #1312)
- [GUI] Downloading a file to the cache shows the download in progress, and refreshes the contents viewer when complete (Postremus, #1231)
- [GUI] On first start we always refresh the modlist, with an option to do so each time the CKAN is loaded (Postremus, #1285)
- [Core] KSP instance names now default to the folder in which they're installed (Postremus, #1261)
- [Core] Processing an updated mod list is now faster, and other speed enhancements (Postremus, #1229)

- [Spec] `install_to` can now target `Ships/` subdirectories (dbent, #1243)

### Internal

- [NetKAN] Cached files have more descriptive file extensions (dbent, #1308)

- [NetKAN] We better handle null values in retrieved metadata (dbent, #1324)
- [NetKAN] Better handling of license strings with leading and trailing spaces (dbent, #1305)
- [Core] We no longer try to use `libcurl` on systems where the .NET web classes are sufficient (dbent, #1294)
